Recently, I was working [on a side project](https://the-killer.online/) and I looked at a small lib I used called [react-nice-avatar](https://github.com/dapi-labs/react-nice-avatar).

This library is really useful for my project since it allows me to generate avatar for my users like this:

![Avatar generated by react-nice-avatar](./preview.png)

But then, I wanted to move away from React and maybe doing a version of the same application using another frontend framework.

The generated Avatar logic is strateforward: it's just conditional component to display or not. So, it could be easily ported to any JSX rendering engine ([Solid.js](https://github.com/solidjs/solid), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Hono](https://hono.dev/guides/jsx), and lot more), no?

So I wanted to port this library to a more extendable library. My objectives are:

1. provide it to as many as possible JSX engines ([Solid.js](https://github.com/solidjs/solid), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), and others)
2. export it as as [Web Component][web-components]
3. export a `render` function to use it in any backend framework without frontend library

Now you might have those questions:

> Couldn't you not simply use a Javascript template library like [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) or [nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/)?

Yes, it could have been a solution but templates languages are easier to maintain in separated files which make it not compatible on frontend. Templates can be defined in the Javascript code but it become a nightmare to maintain it.

> Isn't it too much for a side project? Rewriting your project does not provide value to your APP.

Yes, it's true. But it's mainly to experiment Monorepo & other libraries.

## Building the monorepo

- shared
- element
- render
- preact
- react
- solid
